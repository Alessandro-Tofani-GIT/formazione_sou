#  A simple address database


This script uses an associative array to store the addresses of three people, where the names (Charles, John, Wilma) are the keys and the addresses are the values. After storing the data in the array, the script prints each person's address.

At the end of the script, using the command echo ${!address[*]}, a list of all the keys in the array — that is, the names of the people — is printed.
