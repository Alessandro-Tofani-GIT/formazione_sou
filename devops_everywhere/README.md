# Devops_everywhere

## Description

The Vagrantfile configures an Ubuntu virtual machine with an Apache server. After the machine is started, a provisioning script updates the system, installs Apache, and creates a webpage with information about the DevOps project. The page includes three sections: project objectives, creating the environment, and a creative bonus. Finally, Apache is restarted to apply the changes.
