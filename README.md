# Academy DevOps Track 1 Exercises

## Welcome to formazione_sou

In this repository, I published the track exercises I worked on.

### Ping_pong

Inside the ping_pong directory, there exists an exercise that implements the ping-pong function. When one container is active, the other is inactive. Subsequently, the active container is deactivated, and the previously inactive container is activated.

### Step8

In the Step8 directory, I have provided comments explaining the functionality of each script.

### Devops_everywhere

This Vagrantfile sets up a virtual machine with Ubuntu, configures a private network, installs Apache, and creates a simple HTML page. It then restarts Apache to apply the changes and serve the page.
