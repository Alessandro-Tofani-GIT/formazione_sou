#   Exit / exit status

## Description 

This script prints "hello" and shows the exit code 0 from the echo command, indicating that it executed successfully.
Next, it attempts to run the command lskdf, which does not exist, so it returns the exit code 127, indicating an error (command not found).
Finally, the script exits with the exit code 113, which can be used to represent a custom condition.
